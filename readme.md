##  Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone

# Navigate to project root
cd CodePad

# Install root dependencies
npm install

npm install
npm i gsap

# Backend setup
cd ../backend
npm install
npm install dotenv

# Run both frontend and backend
cd ..
npm run both
```

##  Deployment (Render)

**Reload / direct URL 404 fix:** The app uses client-side routing (React Router). If you reload on a route like `/editor/javascript`, the server must serve `index.html` for that path (SPA fallback) so the React app can load and handle the route.

- **Single service (recommended):** Use the included `render.yaml`. The backend builds the frontend and serves it; all non-API routes serve `index.html`. Set `DB`, `SECRET_KEY`, etc. in the Render Dashboard → Environment.
- **Separate static site + backend:** If the frontend is a separate Static Site on Render, add a **Rewrite** rule in the Dashboard: Source `/*` → Destination `/index.html` so every path serves the SPA. See [Render redirects/rewrites](https://render.com/docs/redirects-rewrites).
